# Summit Portal — Personalized Performance Reports

## Overview

A personalized digital performance report delivered to Adobe Summit attendees who are AEM Sites customers. Each report presents site-specific metrics — traffic, performance scores, AI search visibility, and SEO health — in a polished, data-rich single-page format.

The current content is a **sample report for Nike**, used during development. In production, the same block system will generate unique reports for each Summit attendee's site.

- **Framework**: `ak.js` (Author Kit / Document Authoring)
- **Content source**: https://main--summit-portal--gabrielwalt.aem.page
- **Initial import**: Created via the [Slicc browser extension](https://github.com/ai-ecoverse/slicc)
- **Design**: Fully responsive (single 1000px breakpoint), dark mode support via `light-dark()` CSS, rich data visualizations (SVG charts, gauges, animated counters), smooth animations (typing effect, count-up numbers)

## Blocks

### report-hero (insight variant)
Full-width red banner with a personalized greeting ("Hello, Erika!"), a site description, a brand badge linking to the customer's site (with favicon), and a site screenshot. Features a typing animation on the heading and a decorative SVG background. The screenshot is hidden on mobile.

### report-stats (dark variant)
A horizontal strip of four metric cards on a black background. Each card shows a KPI label, animated count-up value, a color-coded trend badge (positive/negative/critical/optimal), and a description. The performance score card includes an SVG semicircle speedometer; the red fill arc and needle are animated with geometry suited to a ≤180° sweep (selectors `.rs-gauge-fill` / `.rs-gauge-needle` when present). **Experiment:** `.report-stats.dark` pins light-theme colors (`color-scheme: light` + fixed values) so the hero KPI strip stays black with white type regardless of the page color theme toggle.

On insight/Cannes pages, the light **Search performance** block renders the shared `.rav-stats` strip (same markup and CSS as **report-ai-visibility**): sentence-case labels, large values, sublabel descriptions, and a bottom hairline — laid out in a **2×2 grid** (AI visibility keeps 3-across). Severity (`poor` / `good` / `warning`) tints the value only. The strip is a direct child of `.report-stats`; relocated “How to act” / data-source footers sit in a sibling `.rav-panels-outer` below. Summit pages keep the legacy `.rs-grid` card layout.

### report-carousel
A tabbed carousel with three persona views — Executive overview, Marketer insights, and IT/Engineering learnings. Each tab contains multiple slides with a "Top insight" callout and an SVG data visualization (column charts, line charts, donut charts, horizontal bars, stacked bars, big figures, metric strips, or recommendation lists). Includes dot navigation, prev/next arrows, and a slide counter. `bigfigure` accepts the documented single pipe-delimited row (`value | unit | label`) as well as the legacy three-`<p>` form — the renderer reads the pipe parts first so the documented form (what the DIH template emits) doesn't drop the unit/context. Slides use `min-height` (not a fixed `height`) so tall content like a 3-item `recommendationlist` grows to fit instead of clipping; on mobile the `.rc-slide-visual` 300px height cap applies only to SVG charts, not to text-content visuals (`recommendationlist`/`metricstrip`), which must grow.

### report-download
A split layout with a heading, description, and download CTA on the left, and an interactive PDF card preview on the right. The card has a red patterned background, the report title, and hover effects. Shows metadata (last updated date, page count). PDF title text is resolved from the block row markup (including nested links).

### report-ai-visibility
Summit “LLM visibility” / “Performance insights” experience: stat cards, platform coverage pills, side-by-side comparison panels with charts (horizontal bars, platform bars, score tables, big figures). Horizontal bars support count vs percent display (authoring flags `|percent` / `|count`, or inferred share-style totals), and can show platform favicons when labels match known brands. Gap, key insight, and CTA rows render below the panels; the CTA copies from the authored block cells. An empty shell section next to the block hosts the nested **report-scores** page-performance cards (no extra grid padding in that shell). `.rav-panels-outer` stacks its `.rav-panels` cards in a flex column (`gap: 8px`); a lone `.rav-panel` inside `.rav-panels` (e.g. Key findings) uses a full-width flex column on desktop instead of a centered half-track. On Cannes pages, the section-authored “How to act” **report-callout** and “Data source: …” line are relocated into each section’s primary widget footer (inside `.rav-panels-outer` for AI Visibility, Search performance, and Performance insights). Relocated `.report-callout` and `.default-content` footers inside `.rav-panels-outer` share `margin: 8px 0 0` (callouts override to `20px` top). `.default-content` lays out a 28×28px Semrush SVG (`.cannes-source-logo`, no wrapper) and source line in a flex row (`align-items: center`, `gap: 12px`); the SVG is a sibling of `.cannes-source`, not nested inside it, and the source line uses `line-height: 28px` so it vertically centers with the icon. Horizontal inset uses `--rpt-widget-inset` in `cobrand.css` for most widget footers; in the Performance insights empty shell (`.rav-empty-shell`), relocated footers stay edge-to-edge (`padding-inline: 0`) alongside nested **report-scores** cards. Relocation runs per-block during decoration and again via `relocateAllSectionFooters()` from `lazy.js` (`relocate-section-footer.js`).

### report-scores
Page performance cards (URL, score meter, metrics) used inside the AI visibility performance shell and elsewhere. Card grid and meters are scoped under `.report-scores`. The grid is `repeat(2, 1fr)` on desktop for multi-page reports; when a report has a single card (e.g. Cannes' one mobile-experience card) the Cannes scope collapses it to one column so it fills the shared column instead of sitting at half-width.

### report-callout
Icon + text insight bar (`.neutral` and `.cta` variants). Default `.rcl-bar` uses a subtle red-tinted background with no left accent border. The hero KPI strip (`.report-stats.dark > .rpt-widget-footer`) uses a transparent bar with `28px 32px` padding so it reads as inline copy below the dark stats row, not a card — other relocated section footers and CTAs keep their card treatment. The hero Brand Visibility teaser (`.section.rcl-pre-briefing`) uses `.rcl-bar--bv-hero` inside a minimal section shell. The closing `.cta` unwraps to `main > .rcl-bar.rcl-bar--bv-hero.rcl-closing-briefing`, inserted directly after the Performance insights section — no `.section` / `.block-content` / `.report-callout` wrappers. Both match Figma frame `4620:329386` — white `#fff` background + `#292929` copy on light theme, `#262626` background + white copy on dark; separate light/dark Adobe+Semrush lockups (`bv-hero-logo-light.svg` / `bv-hero-logo-dark.svg`) swap with the page theme toggle; decorative mark is Adobe red (`#EB1000`) in both themes. The decorator unwraps a sole wrapping `<p>` from the authored cell before placing the text inside `.rcl-text` — nesting a `<p>` inside `<p class="rcl-text">` is invalid HTML and the browser would split it, leaving `.rcl-text` empty (with `flex-grow:1`) and the real text in a stray sibling, breaking the bar layout. On insight pages, the hero-section `.cta` (Brand Visibility teaser) is relocated into its own `.section.rcl-pre-briefing` immediately above the "Your briefing" section; the closing `.cta` at the page bottom is left in place.

### metadata
Authored page-data block: each row becomes a `<meta>` tag (or sets `document.title` / `lang`), then the block removes itself. **Single-section reports** (e.g. insight reports) author every block — `report-hero`, `report-stats`, `report-carousel`, … plus `metadata` — inside **one** `main > div` section sharing one `.block-content`. So `init()` must NOT remove its `.section` unconditionally: it drops the `.metadata` element, then removes the `.block-content`/`.section` only when nothing else remains. Removing the section unconditionally wiped the entire report (the 18th Digitech regression after PR #73). `hidePageDataSections()` (run from `lazy.js`) is the broader cleanup for standalone page-data sections and is a no-op on single-section reports because the metadata element/markers are already gone by the lazy phase.

### header
Fetches nav content and renders the Adobe logo, site title ("Adobe Summit Portal"), a help icon button, and a dark mode toggle button (half-moon icon) on the right edge. Preference is persisted in localStorage. The actions section renders auth-aware user info from `/auth/me`: signed in → email + Sign out + My Portal; signed out → a **Sign in** link that carries `?redirect=<current path>` so re-auth returns the user to the page they were on. When the non-HttpOnly `signed_in` marker cookie is present but `/auth/me` is unauthenticated, the header shows a small **"Your session expired"** notice (`.user-session-expired`) instead of failing silently — distinguishing a lapsed session from a never-signed-in visitor.

### customer-picker
Staff-facing search/share surface with three modes (Accounts, Insight Reports, Summit 26 Portal), A–Z letter nav, per-format report links, and per-page email sharing via `/auth/sharelink`. Data is fetched live from three DA sheets under `/data/`: `account-list.json` (Accounts), `company-list.json` (Summit 26 Portal), and `insights-list.json` (Insight Reports); CUG email domains come from `/closed-user-groups.json`. A per-mode **Recently viewed** band (localStorage key `cp-recent-<mode>`, capped at 8, deduped by folder, newest-first) renders above the A–Z grid; entries are recorded when a company dialog opens and resolved back to the live mode list by folder (stale entries dropped). All storage access is guarded so a disabled/full localStorage degrades to "no recents" rather than breaking the picker.

**Insight-report grouping (`groupInsightsByWebsite` + `parseInsightFolder`, both exported for tests):** DIH folders are `…/insights/<website>/[variant]/` where `<variant>` is empty (bare report), `portal-landing`, or an event id (`cannes-2026`, `summit-2026`). The website segment is the grouping anchor — one card per website — and **`portal-landing` wins**: when a website has a portal-landing variant the card links straight to it and suppresses every other variant, so people always land on the canonical portal page and the same website never shows twice. With no portal-landing, event variants render as selectable reports (newest-first by label) and a lone bare report renders as a single-link card. Websites filed under different account folders (e.g. `delta.com` under both `/accounts/d/delta/` and `/accounts/d/delta-air-lines/`) stay distinct cards by design — those are duplicate *accounts* in the source sheet, not a grouping bug. Earlier code wrongly treated the website segment itself as the "format" and split bare vs. portal-landing into two cards (~78 duplicate cards); covered by `test/blocks/customer-picker.test.js`.

### footer
Renders copyright text and a horizontal list of legal links (Terms of use, Privacy policy, Cookie preferences, etc.). `loadFooter` awaits block decoration; on **localhost / 127.0.0.1** it skips work if the page has no `<footer>` (avoids fragment fetch noise in local AEM CLI). On other hosts it can create a `<footer>` when missing, then load the footer block.

## Authentication

Auth is handled by the Cloudflare worker in `workers/cloudflare/cug-adobe-oauth-worker` (OAuth+PKCE via Adobe IMS, plus self-service magic links and staff-issued share links; CUG enforcement reads `x-aem-cug-*` headers from the origin). Token/session lifetimes (`src/session.js`): logged-in **session = 4 hours** (`SESSION_TTL`, drives both the signed-JWT `exp` and the `auth_token` cookie `Max-Age`); **magic link = 30 min** (`MAGIC_LINK_MAX_AGE`, self-service freshness); **share link = 7 days** (`SHARE_LINK_TTL`, booth hand-off). Alongside the HttpOnly `auth_token`, the worker sets a non-HttpOnly **`signed_in` marker cookie** (`Max-Age = SESSION_TTL + 1 day`, so it outlives a timed-out session) carrying no identity/authorization — it only lets the header tell "session lapsed" from "never signed in" to show the expiry notice. The marker is set wherever a session is minted (OAuth callback, `?token=` magic/share link) and cleared on `/auth/logout`.

## Design Tokens

Global tokens defined in `styles/styles.css` with `light-dark()` for automatic dark mode. Report blocks alias them via `--rpt-*` tokens:

| Report Token | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--rpt-surface` | Block backgrounds |
| `--rpt-border` | Card borders |
| `--rpt-text` | Primary text color |
| `--rpt-text-body` | Body/description copy (`#292929` / `#ccc`) |
| `--rpt-text-secondary` | Secondary text |
| `--rpt-text-muted` | Muted text |
| `--rpt-red` | Adobe red (`#e60000`) |

## Responsive Design

- **Breakpoint**: 1000px (mobile-first)
- **Desktop (>=1000px)**: Centered blocks, max-width 1200px, 24px side padding, 16px rounded corners
- **Mobile (<1000px)**: Edge-to-edge, no side padding, no rounded corners

### Insight pages — mobile polish
- Section spacing on insight pages collapses to `gap: 8px` with `padding: 0 0 8px` on `main` so the hero is flush against the header (no top gap) while subsequent sections sit 8px apart.
- Hero website badge (`.rh-insight-badge`) keeps the desktop white-pill styling on mobile (no dark-transparent override).
- Dark KPI strip (`.report-stats.dark .rs-dark-strip`) is a single solid-black surface on mobile — no 1px dividers between the 4 cells.
- Dark KPI strip's scroll-hint chevron + 36px bottom padding only apply when there is no `.rpt-widget-footer` callout below the grid (`:not(:has(.rpt-widget-footer))`) so the at-a-glance callout doesn't have empty space below it.
- Widget title bars unify across blocks: `.rai-section-head-strip` matches `.rav-section-head` at `(width < 768px)` — `min-height: 56px`, `padding: 10px 16px`, `font-size: 16px / 600`. "Your briefing" / "Search performance" read as peers of "LLM visibility" / "Performance insights".
- `.report-ai-visibility .rav-stats` uses `repeat(2, 1fr)` at every width (was 3-up base + 3-up `<768px`). LLM visibility's two stats sit at 50/50; tablet rule already used 2 columns.

## Remaining Work

### Polish
- Footer styling could be improved (currently uses default list rendering)
- Header nav sections are hidden (`display: none`) — could show on desktop
- Accessibility: Chart SVGs need better `aria-label` descriptions

### Potential Enhancements
- Report-carousel: Slide transition animations could be smoother
- Performance: Images in content/ are not optimized
